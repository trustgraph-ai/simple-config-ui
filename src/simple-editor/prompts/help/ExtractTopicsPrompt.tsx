                The purpose of the "Topics Definition" prompt is to extract
                intangible concepts from a text corpus along with a
                definition of that concept.  Below are tailoring
                instructions:
            </Typography>

            <Typography variant="body1" component="p" gutterBottom>
                1. The chunked text from the ingested documents can be placed 
                anywhere in the prompt using the variable
                <code>{'{{text}}'}</code>.
            </Typography>

            <Typography variant="body1" component="p" gutterBottom>
                2. The LLM response from this prompt must have the
                following JSON object structure to form correct RDF triples:
            </Typography>

            <PromptCode>
                { '{\n'}
                { '   "topic": string,\n' }
                { '   "definition": string\n' }
                { '}'}
            </PromptCode>

            <Typography variant="body1" component="p" gutterBottom>
                3. Most LLMs will understand the instruction to return
                an array of the above JSON objects without explicitly
                using array notation in the prompt.
            </Typography>

            <Typography variant="body1" component="p" gutterBottom>
                4. Be precise. Be succinct. Be consistent. In general, 
                less is more with LLM prompts. 
            </Typography>

            <Typography variant="body1" component="p" gutterBottom>
                5. The TrustGraph prompts services can parse code
                delimiters such as ```json``` or simply ``````.
            </Typography>

            <Typography variant="body1" component="p" gutterBottom>
                6. Modify the prompt text below. The modified prompt
                will be packaged in the TrustGraph deployment automatically.
            </Typography>

        </Box>
